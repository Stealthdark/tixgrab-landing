                  <h5 class="font-weight-bold">1. Our Service</h5>
                  <p>
                    1.1 TixGrab is an art community platform catering to
                    artists, art enthusiasts, art businesses, and journalists.
                    It serves as a communication platform, social media portal,
                    and community for musicians and artists worldwide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    1.2 Our platform includes a “Forum” section to help artists
                    express themselves, an “Event Calendar” section to inform
                    you about notable events globally, and a direct “Booking”
                    section for event organizers and booking agents to engage
                    artists.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    1.3 We support artists as curators by offering databases of
                    venues, agents, and galleries and facilitating direct
                    bookings and sales.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    1.4 We provide a free database, serving as a key search
                    engine for artists, labels, and curators.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    1.5 Music streaming is a significant component of TixGrab.
                    We operate our own streaming servers, connecting artist and
                    record label profiles, allowing for high-quality audio
                    uploads, and providing a unique service in the Indian music
                    industry. Music content can be sold as physical and/or
                    digital copies through secure local payment gateways, easing
                    the process for artists to showcase and sell their work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    1.6 TixGrab also offers consultancy services to artists
                    regarding Indian laws, organizations, and their rights. We
                    will not participate in disputes but provide advisory
                    services as needed.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    1.7 We aim to assist artists by running fundraising
                    campaigns to cover/subsidize their costs and organize
                    resources to support new art creation and expand the artist
                    community.
